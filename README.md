# 2020-Scouting-App
The stand scouting app for the 2020 First Robotics competition
The app is made to store and receive game data on the competition First Recharge
The app initially starts on the screen shown below
Signing in (please talk to scouting lead for username and password )allows the user to receive, store, and view  data. Clicking Start Scouting however will enable the user to record data throughout one game of the competition starting with auto shown below.
Once auto data is entered it is saved and the user can click to go to teleop data.


 
Rotation control is from 0 (no rotation) to 2(able to control placement)
Endgame is shown below
After all data is entered clicking the advertise button will turn on Bluetooth. The device with master mode must also press advertise in the Master main activity shown below to transfer the data. Otherwise a QR code can be created. The exit button ensures all saved data such as what was inputted in teleop will be deleted on the devices so the next scouter can use a blank scouting form.
  

Clicking the camera icon allows QR code scanning and Advertise turns on Bluetooth to receive any data from advertisers. The distance between devices advertising must be less than 5 feet away. The View Data button goes to the activity shown below

  The data can be viewed through this horizontally scrolling table. However, to analyze and share the data it is recommended to download a csv file by clicking the button on the bottom right corner.
Thank you,
We hope you enjoy the 2020 Spartabot’s scouting app
