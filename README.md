After all data is entered clicking the advertise button will turn on Bluetooth. The device with master mode must also press advertise in the Master main activity shown below to transfer the data. Otherwise a QR code can be created. The exit button ensures all saved data such as what was inputted in teleop will be deleted on the devices so the next scouter can use a blank scouting form.

Clicking the camera icon allows QR code scanning and Advertise turns on Bluetooth to receive any data from advertisers. The distance between devices advertising must be less than 5 feet away. The View Data button goes to the activity shown below
